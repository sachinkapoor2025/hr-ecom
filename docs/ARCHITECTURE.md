# HR E-Commerce Platform — Architecture

## Goals

- Full-featured e-commerce (catalog, cart, checkout, orders, admin)
- Dual payment gateways: **Stripe** (USA) and **Razorpay** (India), region-configurable
- Customer capture at every touchpoint (partial name/email saved for outreach)
- **SEO-first** storefront (SSR, metadata, sitemap, structured data)
- **AI-driven development**: developers use Cursor prompts; no manual redeploy for code edits
- **Multi-developer**: Git + branch workflow; Cursor rules keep changes consistent
- **AWS serverless**, near-zero idle cost, auto-scales under load

## Why This Stack

| Layer | Choice | Idle cost | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 (App Router) | ~$0 on Amplify/OpenNext | SSR/SSG for SEO; deploy from GitHub without Docker |
| API | API Gateway + Lambda | $0 | Pay per request |
| Database | DynamoDB on-demand | ~$0 | No provisioned capacity; no RDS always-on cost |
| Auth | Cognito User Pool | Free tier | Login/logout, JWT, admin roles |
| Files | S3 + CloudFront | Pennies | Product images, bulk CSV uploads |
| Payments | Stripe + Razorpay | $0 until transaction | Config-driven per region |
| IaC | AWS SAM | $0 | Simpler than raw CloudFormation for serverless |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Free tier | Push → deploy infra + app |

**No Docker for app code** — GitHub Actions builds and deploys directly. Cursor edits code → push → auto deploy. Docker only if you later need custom runtimes (not required now).

## DynamoDB Multi-Table Design

Per-domain tables (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`), named `hr-ecom-<domain>-{env}` and wired into
the Lambda via env vars (`PRODUCTS_TABLE`, `ORDERS_TABLE`, `CARTS_TABLE`,
`CUSTOMERS_TABLE`, `EVENTS_TABLE`, `CONFIG_TABLE`).

| Table | PK | SK | Notes / GSIs |
|-------|----|----|--------------|
| products | `PRODUCT#<slug>` / `CATEGORY#<slug>` | `META` | GSI1 `CATEGORY#<slug>` → products |
| orders | `ORDER#<orderId>` | `META` | GSI1 byCustomer (`USER#<key>`), GSI2 byDate (`ENTITY#ORDER`), GSI3 byStatus (`STATUS#<status>`) |
| carts | `CART#<userKey>` | `META` | GSI1 byUpdatedAt (`ENTITY#CART`) + `itemCount`; TTL `expiresAt` |
| customers | `SESSION#<sessionId>` | `PROFILE` / `LEAD#<ts>` | GSI1 lead feed (`ENTITY#LEAD`) |
| events | `SESSION#<sessionId>` | `<ts>#<eventId>` | GSI1 byTypeDay (`<type>#<yyyy-mm-dd>`); TTL `expiresAt` (90d). Rollups: PK `ROLLUP#<yyyy-mm-dd>`. Product sales: PK `PRODUCT_SALES#<yyyy-mm-dd>` / SK `META` or `PRODUCT#<slug>` |
| config | `CONFIG#PAYMENTS` | `META` | Stripe/Razorpay settings |
| config | `CONFIG#SHIPPING` | `META` | USPS rate-shopping, origin address, festival mode |

Order status lifecycle: `pending_payment → paid → (accepted/on_hold) → processing → shipped → in_transit → out_for_delivery → delivered → complete`
(plus `delivery_exception`, `cancelled` / `refunded`), with a `statusHistory[]` audit trail and tracking number.

**USPS tracking sync (single source of truth):** Order `status` plus carrier fields (`carrierTrackingStatus`, `carrierStatusDetail`, `trackingEvents[]`, `lastTrackingSyncAt`, `lastTrackingSyncError`, `lastTrackingNotificationStatus`, `deliveredAt`, `estimatedDeliveryAt`) live on the order item. Admin portal and customer My Orders / order detail both read this same record — there is no separate customer status cache. Cron `processUspsTrackingSync` (EventBridge every 15 minutes on `ReviewEmailsCronFunction`, task `trackingSync`) queries GSI3 for active poll statuses (`processing`/`shipped`/`in_transit`/`out_for_delivery`/`delivery_exception` with a tracking number), calls USPS Tracking API v3, maps via `@hr-ecom/shared` `mapCarrierTrackingPhase`, advances `status` only forward (never overwrites `cancelled`/`refunded`/`complete`), emails only on meaningful status change (`lastTrackingNotificationStatus` dedupe), and stops polling once status is `delivered`/`complete`. Admin manual refresh: `POST /admin/orders/{orderId}/tracking/sync`. Customer read: `GET /orders/{orderId}/tracking` (or full `GET /orders/{orderId}`).

**Orange County vendor tracking:** `POST /vendors/orange-county/tracking` accepts enum statuses (`in_transit`, `delivered`) **or** free-text USPS scan lines (e.g. `Arrived at USPS Regional Destination Facility`). Those strings are mapped with the same `mapCarrierTrackingPhase` layer and advance `order.status` for admin + customer together.

Migration from the legacy single table: `npm run migrate:multitable` (copies orders +
leads/sessions; products re-seed via `import:usarakhi`).

## Background jobs

| Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `ReviewEmailsCronFunction` | Every 15 minutes | Review emails + abandoned cart + pending-payment reminders |
| `ReviewEmailsCronFunction` (`task: trackingSync`) | Every 15 minutes | **USPS tracking sync** for active shipments (`processUspsTrackingSync`) |
| `ReviewEmailsCronFunction` (review path) | As due | One-time **review request** (email + WhatsApp) for **Delivered** / **Complete** if a channel still failed; primary send is immediate on first status change |

When admin (or Orange County vendor tracking) changes order status (accepted, processing, shipped, delivered, complete, cancelled, refunded, or paid), the API emails **both** the customer at `shippingAddress.email` and the ops inbox (`order@usarakhi.com` / `NOTIFY_EMAIL`) via **SMTP** (`notifyCustomerOrderStatusChange` in `apps/api/src/lib/email.ts` — same transactional path as paid confirmation). Admin copy includes customer contact, items, tracking, and an admin order link so the team need not open the portal for every update. **Marketing campaigns** (`/ses-email/*`, admin Email) send via **marketing SMTP** (default Mailercloud `smtp-prod.mailrcld.com:587`) configured under Admin → Email → Settings; Amazon SES API remains an optional legacy transport if `marketingTransport=ses`. Transactional `SMTP_*` env is separate and unchanged. Shipped emails include carrier/tracking when present. `pending_payment` → `cancelled` skips the customer/status pair (admin payment-failed alert only).

**Delivered / Complete review request (once per order):** The first time an order reaches `delivered` or `complete` (admin, vendor tracking, or USPS sync), `dispatchReviewRequest` sends a transactional **review request** through the same SMTP path as order-status mail (`sendEmail()` → `order@usarakhi.com` in `apps/api/src/lib/email.ts`) and WhatsApp. Copy uses the same plain-text layout as delivered/complete emails (greeting, order number, confirmation, `— UsaRakhi Team` footer); HTML is the same newline→`<br>` conversion plus stacked **Leave a Review** and **Review us on Google** buttons. Includes delivery confirmation, a **Leave a Review** button (`/reviews` by default), and a separate **Review us on Google** button. A channel is marked **Sent** only after the SMTP / WhatsApp provider returns success (`reviewEmailSentAt` / `reviewWhatsAppSentAt` plus provider message id/status). Missing email is **Not Available** (`reviewEmailUnavailableAt`); missing phone is **Not Available** (`reviewWhatsAppSkippedAt`) — not Failed. Provider failures store `reviewEmailLastError` / `reviewWhatsAppLastError` and an append-only `reviewNotificationLog[]`. Admin **Orders → order detail → Review Notification Status** shows per-channel status and **Retry Email** / **Retry WhatsApp** (retries only that channel). Saving Delivered again or later changing Delivered → Complete does **not** resend a successful channel; a failed channel may still be retried. Status update always succeeds if email/WhatsApp fails; the 15-minute cron retries unsent/failed channels. Settings: `CONFIG#REVIEW_REQUEST` (Admin → Marketing Email → Review request). Generic delivered/complete customer status email is skipped on that first send so the shopper is not emailed twice. From/Reply-To are `order@usarakhi.com` (never the customer). Inbox placement depends on DNS for `usarakhi.com`: SPF must authorize `smtp.usarakhi.com`, DKIM should sign mail from that host, and DMARC should be `p=none` or stricter at `_dmarc.usarakhi.com`. Confirm with `nslookup -type=txt usarakhi.com` / `_dmarc.usarakhi.com` at the DNS host — this repo cannot change DNS.

**WhatsApp (optional, additive):** When Meta Cloud API (`WHATSAPP_TOKEN` + `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`) and/or Twilio (`TWILIO_*`) env vars are set, the same customer notifications also send via WhatsApp (`apps/api/src/lib/whatsapp.ts` → `notifyCustomerWhatsApp`): welcome/admin/abandoned coupons, order paid + status updates, pending-payment reminders, review requests, contact ack, abandoned-cart recovery. Email remains primary — WhatsApp failures never block checkout or SMTP. Admin abandoned coupons still return a `wa.me` deep link when APIs are unset. For Meta out-of-session sends, set an approved `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_NAME` (freeform text only works inside the 24h customer-care window). Twilio WhatsApp **sandbox/trial is capped at 50 messages/day** (error `63038`); that is recorded as a **Failed** (retryable) send, not Sent. After the cap, Meta is tried as fallback; Retry WhatsApp / the 15-minute cron send again after the cap resets (typically midnight UTC) or after the Twilio sender is upgraded off sandbox.

**Pending-payment reminders (SMTP):** While an order stays `pending_payment`, the shared 15‑minute cron (`scheduled.handler` → `processPendingPaymentReminders`) emails the customer **once per America/New_York calendar day** (first send ≥ 2 hours after checkout). Campaign ends after **2026-08-28** (last reminder day). Stops immediately when status leaves `pending_payment` (paid/cancelled). Also skips when the same `shippingAddress.email` already has any **payment-settled** order (paid → complete / refunded) so a shopper who paid one checkout is not nudged about a leftover unpaid duplicate — paid-order status / shipping emails are unchanged. Tracked via `pendingPaymentReminderLastDateKey` / `pendingPaymentReminderCount`.

**Pending-payment unsubscribe:** Reminder emails include a link to `/unsubscribe/payment-reminders` (email prefilled). `POST /pending-payment-unsubscribe` stores the address in DynamoDB table `hr-ecom-pending-payment-unsub-{env}` (`PENDING_PAYMENT_UNSUB_TABLE`). The cron skips any order whose `shippingAddress.email` is on that list. This list is separate from SES marketing suppression.

### Scale notes (catalog / concurrency)

- DynamoDB stays on-demand (scales with traffic; no always-on fee).
- Catalog: categories via GSI1 (no Scan); short in-memory + `Cache-Control` on public GETs.
- Events: `page_view` rollups sampled to protect hot partitions.
- Cart: parallel Gets + single Put.
- Optional later: Lambda provisioned concurrency if cold-start p95 must drop (adds fixed monthly cost).

### Product Sales Intelligence

Admin **Product Sales Intelligence** (`/admin/product-sales`) aggregates **paid order line items** into product-level performance.

**Include:** `paid | accepted | on_hold | processing | shipped | delivered | complete`  
**Exclude:** `pending_payment`, `cancelled`, payment IDs matching `_loadtest_` / `_dev_`  
**Refunds:** full-order `refunded` status only (no partial refund amounts). Refund merchandise is attributed to the original paid day and excluded from revenue.

**Metrics (order-time data):**
- Gross = `(line unit price + add-ons) × qty`
- Discount allocated by eligible merchandise share of order-level `discount`
- Net = gross − allocated discount
- Estimated profit = net USD − `vendorCost × qty` when cost is known (line snapshot preferred); otherwise `null`
- Orders = unique orders containing the SKU; Units = sum of quantities

**Scale:** daily rollups on the events table — `PK=PRODUCT_SALES#yyyy-mm-dd`, `SK=META|PRODUCT#slug`. Paid/refund status changes mark the day dirty; next dashboard read rebuilds that day. Growth-score weights live in `CONFIG#PRODUCT_SALES_INTEL`.

**Unavailable (intentionally null until integrated):** page views, add-to-cart, conversion, ad spend, ROAS, repeat-purchase rate, geo/segment splits.

| GET | `/admin/sessions/{sessionId}` | Admin: full visitor journey |
| GET | `/admin/customers/{email}` | Admin: unified customer profile (orders, leads, carts, sessions) |
| GET | `/admin/search` | Admin: global search by name/email/phone (`?q=`) |
| GET | `/admin/carts/abandoned` | Admin: abandoned carts (CSV in UI) |
| GET | `/admin/leads` | Admin: captured leads |
| GET/POST | `/ses-email/reminders*` | Admin: checkout-nudge audience (manual fetch, send, soft-delete). UI: `/admin/email/nudges` |
| GET/POST | `/ses-email/*` | Marketing campaigns (admin auth): dashboard, campaigns, recipients, templates, queue, analytics (+ per-email activity), suppression, bounce sync, settings. UI at `/admin/email` |
| POST | `/webhooks/mailercloud` | Mailercloud bounce/complaint/unsub → marketing `SUPPRESS#` (skipped on next import/send) |
| GET | `/email/open/{token}` | Open tracking pixel |

| GET | `/blog-images` | Public blog hero image map (slug → URL) |
| PUT | `/admin/blog-images` | Admin: update blog hero images |

## Payment Flow

1. Checkout reads `CONFIG#PAYMENTS` → region (`US` → Stripe, `IN` → Razorpay)
2. Create order in DynamoDB (status: `pending_payment`)
3. Create Stripe PaymentIntent or Razorpay Order
4. Client completes payment (Razorpay also calls `POST /payments/razorpay/verify`)
5. **Webhook is source of truth** (`POST /webhooks/stripe`, `POST /webhooks/razorpay`) → `paid` + inventory
6. Safety net: hourly cron reconciles Razorpay `pending_payment` orders against Razorpay capture API; admin can **Sync payment from Razorpay** on the order page

**Temporary Stripe hold:** `STRIPE_PAYMENTS_ENABLED` in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` (currently `false`) hides Stripe on checkout and blocks new Stripe PaymentIntents. Set it to `true` and redeploy to re-enable. Existing Stripe webhooks still work for any in-flight intents.

Requires GitHub secret `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and Razorpay Dashboard webhook to `{API}/webhooks/razorpay` for events `payment.captured`, `order.paid`, `qr_code.credited`.

Secrets (Stripe/Razorpay keys) live in **SSM Parameter Store** / **Secrets Manager** / GitHub Actions secrets, never in code.

## Customer / Lead Capture

Every form blur or debounced keystroke can POST to `/leads`:

- Anonymous `sessionId` (cookie) + optional `userId` after login
- Fields: name (partial OK), email, phone, page, product viewed
- Stored as `LEAD#` and `SESSION#` for CRM-style outreach

## SEO

- Next.js `generateMetadata` per product/category page
- `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` dynamic routes
- JSON-LD Product schema on product pages
- Canonical URLs, Open Graph tags

## Multi-Developer + Cursor Workflow

1. Clone repo, open in Cursor
2. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/`
3. Log into admin portal locally or staging
4. Prompt: *"Add wishlist feature"* or *"Improve checkout UX"*
5. Cursor edits `apps/web` and `apps/api` following conventions
6. Push branch → PR → GitHub Actions deploys to staging
7. Multiple devs: feature branches, shared types in `packages/shared`

Admin credentials for staging are in team 1Password / SSM — developers never share source code in prompts; Cursor has repo access.

## AWS Deployment (GitHub Actions)

```
push main → build shared → build api → sam deploy → build web → Amplify/OpenNext deploy
```
